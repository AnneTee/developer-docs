## Git commit messages

My favorite guide to follow is [this one](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
Mostly because it has an easy [rule set to follow](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#separate)
which is:

> 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
> 1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
> 1. Capitalize the subject line
> 1. Do not end the subject line with a period
> 1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
> 1. Wrap the body at 72 characters
> 1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
