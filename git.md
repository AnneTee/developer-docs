## Git commit messages

Good git commit messages are helpful for consistency with your collaborators. They also make your code workflow thoughtful and professional. There doesn't seem to be an industry-wide standard on _the_ perfect message format, but for our purposes, the most helpful guide to reference is [this one](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). It proposes this easy [rule set to follow](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules):

> 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
> 1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
> 1. Capitalize the subject line
> 1. Do not end the subject line with a period
> 1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
> 1. Wrap the body at 72 characters
> 1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

Please read through and reference the post for more detail on each of the items above.

We also have a few in-house additions to this:

> 1. Reference the relevant Redmine/GitHub issue at the beginning of each commit, e.g. "Issue #123: Fix git commit message docs"
> 1. If you find yourself leaving important/lengthy notes in the commit body, consider whether that message should also be present as code comments for improved discoverability
