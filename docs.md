# Write the docs

## Building the project locally

Install the `sphinx` and `sphinx-autobuild` python utilities:

``` sh
$ pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild --user
```

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The <code>--user</code> flag is to install these libraries into your user directory to avoid problems with your system install. You can also use <code>virtualenv</code> to create a per-directory python virtual environment.</p>
</div>

You have two options for viewing the docs locally. You can build the docs using `make html` and then open the `_build/html/index.html` file in your browser.

Alternatively, run `make livehtml` and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the docs. The HTML is updated as you edit the Markdown source files â€” no browser reload required!
