## Git commit messages

Good git commit messages are helpful for consistency with your collaborators. 
They also make your workflow look thoughtful and professional. There doesn't
seem to be an industry-wide standard on _the_ perfect message format, but for 
our purposes, the most helpful guide to reference is 
[this one](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
It proposes this easy 
[rule set to follow](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules):

> 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
> 1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
> 1. Capitalize the subject line
> 1. Do not end the subject line with a period
> 1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
> 1. Wrap the body at 72 characters
> 1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
